Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes;
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner;
    PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes;
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Installation
    -Windows
        1. Download https://git-scm.com/download/win
        or use PowerShell:
             winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
        2. Install by default
        3. Check version
            in Git Bash console: git --version      / if you can see the version - Ok/
                                 git --help         / will provide you more information /


        You have an option:
                    -use Git Bash console
                    -use Terminal in Visual Studio Code (ctrl + ~)
                        *Anyway you have to use Linux commands like cd,ll, mkdir, etc

        4. Create a folder for your repository using cd, mkdir, etc. You may use windows explorer as well
                Example:
                    cd /d/Install/GIT
                    mkdir my_way; cd my_way            
        5. Initialisation the repository
                    git init        / Inside the folder my_way will be created the hidden folder .git /

        6. We have to set a username and email
                Example:
                    git config --global "Radik Makhmudov"
                    git config --global Radik.M@itbumper.com
                    git config --list / check global configuration /

        7. Start using

        The levels 
            1. Working directory
                -create a folder 
                -create a file and edit
                The first state of new folders and files are "Untracked"  / Folders - green dot, files marked "U" in file explorer" /   
                Example:
                    mkdir GIT; cd GIT
                    touch a0001_git
                    git status  /shows the current branch name, untracked files and folders /
                        $ On branch main
                        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
                        Untracked files:
                        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
                        GIT/
                        nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
                
            2. Staging area (index)  /files and folders --> .git/objects
                Example:
                    git add GIT/
                    git status
                        $ On branch main
                        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
                        Changes to be committed:
                        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
                        new file:   GIT/a0001_git
                    Files marked "A" (Added) in file explorer
                    to add * folders and files use git add .

                If file was changed then
                    git status
                        $ On branch main
                        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
                        Changes to be committed:
                        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
                        new file:   GIT/a0001_git
                        Changes not staged for commit:
                        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
                        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
                        modified:   GIT/a0001_git
                    Files marked "M" (Modifided) in file explorer
                    then do
                    git add /GIT or git add GIT/a0001_git   / status will change: "M" will become "A" /
