# Things happen, baby; it is a life!

# My name is Radik and I've created this repository for a few reasons:
# I want to get new skills and improve existing skills working with tools like VS Code, Git, scripting (Bash), Doker, K8S, Ansible, etc
# The other reason, I want to improve my English skills
# A couple of months ago, my son started to study Python and I hope it will be useful for him too.
# I wish me good luck!
